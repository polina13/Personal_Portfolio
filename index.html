        <p class="bio-p">  As a Junior Web Developer from Portland, OR who was born and raised in an Eastern European Country 12 years ago, I have always been passionate about numbers, stats and how they impact people's lives. Previously, I was a case manager for the State of Oregon where I managed a highly secured DHS code system before I made the leap to become a creator. I am constantly building, editing and re-formating programs to enrich lives. I recently graduated from Epicodus where I focused on the Java/Android track where I gained skills such as intital creations of applications all the way to integration and unit testing. As a learning extraordinaire I am always on the lookout to improve my skills and gain some new ones.</p>

        <p>Some of my interests are my family and my development career. I enjoy learnig new programming languages, going to meet ups, and developing personal projects in my free time. Taking the track Java/Javascript/Android made me more detailed-oriented and open more interests for me in this field. On the personal side, my family is my everything. If I had to describe myself with a few words. <strong> "Loving mother and wife, passionate developer, and experimental cooker."</strong></p>
